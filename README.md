# Museum_of_Candy

- This is a code along from a course that I am currently taking. The purpose of this project is to be able to visualize how HTML, CSS, JS and bootstrap work together.
- Once I complete my Javascript learning, my intentions are to come back to this project to somehow make it my own.
